                            A home energy rating is an estimated calculation into a homes potential energy usage, which will determine the amount of heating and cooling required to make its occupants comfortable. It produces a star rating dependant on the amount of heating and cooling loads which will be required, from 0 to 10 stars.

                            In most Australian states the government requires that all new homes and apartments (along with certain types of building extensions) built since 2010 be energy rated and achieve a minimum of 6 Stars.

                            Simple energy rating prices vary greatly on the size and type of building, generally an energy rating will cost somewhere between $130 to $700+.

                            Depended on the size of the extension you are building there is a chance that it too will need to be energy rated. It&#x27;s always best to check first before going ahead with construction.
